# Little Buddy

Firmware for the [PineBuds Pro](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineBuds_Pro). Hopefully.

> **WARNING**: use at your own risk; this is currently worse than the factory default

The following button taps/hold actions are currently mapped:

| taps   | single bud     | left           | right       |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| single | play/pause     | play/pause     | play/pause  |
| double | next track     | previous track | next track  |
| triple | volume up      | volume up      | volume down |
| quad   | volume down    | ---            | ---         |
| hold   | previous track | toggle anc     | toggle anc  |

## install

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/hall/little-buddy/releases).

Flash both earbuds with [`bestool`](https://github.com/Ralim/bestool):

    bestool write-image --port /dev/ttyACM0 little-buddy-*.bin
    bestool write-image --port /dev/ttyACM1 little-buddy-*.bin

> **NOTE**: if you have [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) installed, you can use `nix run 'github:hall/little-buddy#bestool'` instead of building and installing it yourself

## languages

The following languages of audio alerts are currently supported:

| name      | translation | code |
| --------- | :---------- | :--- |
| عربى      | Arabic      | ar   |
| বাংলা        | Bengali     | bn   |
| Deutsche  | German      | de   |
| English   | English     | en   |
| Español   | Spanish     | es   |
| Français  | French      | fr   |
| हिंदी        | Hindi       | hi   |
| 日本      | Japanese    | ja   |
| Português | Portuguese  | pl   |
| русский   | Russian     | ru   |
| 中国人    | Chinese     | zh   |

As they are autogenerated, new languages are both easy to add and likely to have inconsistencies.
Feel free to open an issue in either case.
## attribution

Thus far, I've written almost none of this.
All credit goes to the original authors.

### name

The upstream tarball was named "Little Whale" so I combined that with the device name :shrug:

### others

You may also want to check out the [OpenPineBuds](https://github.com/pine64/OpenPineBuds) project which is more established (and likely by better stewards).
This project takes non-trivial inspiration from there.
